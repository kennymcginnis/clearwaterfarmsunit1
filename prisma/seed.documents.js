ATTENDEES
Board (6) Laurie Morgan, Marcy Squires, Katie Kim, John Kim, Mary Anne & Kevin Walter. Others (5) Mark Squires, John Stinner, Brit Callahan, Dene Bleeker, Jaye Leffler & Bev Mills.
CALLED TO ORDER: 7:04 PM by Laurie.
HANDOUTS: Agenda, Minutes & Financial Reports for May.
Board Matters;
Review of the Minutes & Financial reports for May. Kevin questioned the cost of the Website is for two years. This includes the domain name, website backup basic, .com renew (1-year) and domain privacy & protection Motion by Marcy to accept the Minutes & Financials as published. 2ND by John. Voted unanimous.
Irrigation:
The current irrigation run is 620.5 hours with 189 properties receiving water. We didn't have many problems outside of one person (Atwood) who looked at the schedule and was on the wrong page (Wood). Bev contacted them and resolved the problem. Still have people who think we should be able to have the water levels be the same every time. We can only deal with what they put into our system. MWD has been pretty consistent the last few runs.
Complaint that someone was rude to Lorenzo while he was working on the system. I didn't know who it was so I posted on Nextdoor that he was employed by the Association and to treat him with respect. It was Ms. Young on ditch #9 and she responded about how he had filled the ditch up with weeds after her yard guy had just clean up the area. So posted numerous times justifying the way she treated him. I just told her that if I had known who it was, I would have just called her. John stated that he had talked to Lorenzo about weed eating while the water was running.
Bev will remind him to be sure not to work on an area that is running water.

Old Business:
Done's reply
Dropped driveways. Bev counted them but Bill thinks that there are more. So, they are going to recheck to make sure none were missed. Some of them are hard to see unless you walk the system.
Status of the pigs on Northern. One pig is gone the other two are still there. If they aren't gone by the June 15th. Dene wanted to know if send out a violation notice? We send out a letter stating that we have a complaint of pigs on the property. This includes the section of the C.C & R's regarding "hogs". The attorney states that the term hogs, pigs and swine are
interchangeable. The restrictions state "no hogs of any kind". We will wait to see if they contact us before the 15th.
No word from Rodreguiz property. He appears to be working on the issue but still has a long way to go.
New Business:
Mr. Callahan questioned who maintains the east west access
(Orangewood) this is part of our road system. The Association maintains it. He stated that his neighbors had sculped the bar ditch on the east side and he feels that it could be a problem.
He also questioned about the term property owner. That we had a Board member who was not an owner of record. Marcy stated that this issue had been resolved.
Member Input:
Dene questioned about the fuel costs for the irrigation truck. He did the math (total cost of the fuel divided by $4.49 per gallon times 15 mpg) he came up with 706 miles. At this point Marcy asked him what he was doing with his phone. He is videotaping. He wanted to know if we were taping the meeting which we are. He felt that Bev's phone wouldn't pick up what certain people in the meeting said. He asked for a copy of the recording.



His explanation was for Documentation and transparency. Marcy had sent him an email stating that our attorney advised us that we weren't required to give him a copy of the tapes of the meeting. He said he never got any
emails.
Katie stated that the Minutes were the record of the meeting. Dene's reply
was it just someone option of history.
He stated that Bill had stated that he had driven as much as 500 miles running water in one month. Kevin wanted to know how the cost of the is calculated. If we were actually paying mileage which is .65 cent per mile it would cost us a lot more than the cost of the fuel. Marcy felt that Dene wa saying the we were lying about the cost of the gas. Again, he argues that we are a HOA not a POA. He wants to know why our dues are twice as much as some of the other units. Dene felt that we have two people who are salaried plus all their fringe benefits, free water, free gas, and health insurance. The Association only pays for the Mills irrigation. Workman compensation is required by law and is not it is not health insurance. Dene doesn't buy that he could drive that much within the development. Did this include driving to the General store to pick up hay? Bev stated that it is their truck. Dene also stated that the Association paid $1,200 to replace th motor in that truck. Bev explained that the motor was not in the Toyota it was the GMC and that was probably 20 years ago. Again, the Board decided that because the truck was used mostly for servicing the irrigation the Association should pay half of the cost of the repairs.
He is requesting to exam the books for the past three years. He wants to see the bank statement and cancelled checks to verify who the checks are actually made out to. Receipts for expenditures. Katie stated that the financials have everything lists by category. Dene's reply was that he didn' know what irrigation supplies entailed and who was getting the money. It's just a line item on the report. Marcy stated that she would be at any meeting with Dene and Bev to be there as a representee of the Board and to prevent Den from beating up on Bev the whole time. Marcy can set up meeting Monday 12th at 11 am. This will be a two-hour meeting.
Kevin brought up the fact that the By-Laws states that only one person can be a member. So that only one property owner could be a Board member. In the past we have had wife and husbands on the Board at the same time He also felt that because the By-Laws were written back in the by John 70's do we need to update them. He felt that term limits were the biggest



Crected
biggest time. Motion to table this until the August meeting. Motion by John. 2nd by Katie.
Dene felt that the way we vote at the annual meeting should be looked at. He also felt that term limits should be looked at.
Dene felt that there are reasons that people don't come to the meeting. Kevin stated that people just aren't interested. Brit expressed his opinion about past Board members. Marcy felt that the Board had tried really hard
to address concerns from the community.
John Stinner wanted to know what we could do to block off our roads from outside truck traffic with a gate on our road. So, everyone would have to exit the development from Orangewood. John Kim felt that to restrict traffic and make everyone who lives in Unit 1 to exit from Orangewood would be too restrictive to the people who live here. We have researched the cost o gates in the past and they were $100,000 at that time.
Motion to adjourn by Katie. 2nd by Marcy. Voted unanimous. Meeting adjourned at 8:17 P.M.
