DECLARATION OF CONDITIONS,
COVENANTS AND RESTRICTIONS

THIS DECLARATION is made this 10th day of September, 1979, by Clearwater Farms,
an Arizona limited partnership ( the “Declarant”).

I. Declaration

1.0 The Declarant is the fee owner of that property as described on attached
Exhibit A being all of Resubdivision of Unit 42, Romola of Arizona Grapefruit Unit,
according to the plat of record in the office of the Maricopa County Recorder, in Book 18
of Maps, at Page 40, with such exceptions as noted on Exhibit-A, being a subdivision
located in Section 3, Township 2 North, Rage 2 West. The Declarant intends to offer the
lots for sale and desires to establish the nature of the use and enjoyment of the property
for the benefit of all owners and to make provisions for the irrigation of the lots and the
maintenance of the irrigation system, and roadways shown as roadway easements on the
aforesaid recorded plat which are not maintained by the County.

1.1 The irrigation system consists of ditches through which water is supplied by :
the Maricopa County Water Conservation District No. 1.

2.Establishment

2.0 Declarant hereby declares that the irrigation system and roadways (other than
County) shall be used by the owners (which term “owners” shall also include purchasers
under contract, Declarant and Clearwater Farms) of the lots and their lawful permitees in
benefit to each of the lots. The irrigation system, the roadways, and the owners thereof
shall be subject to the obligations, liabilities, covenants, conditions and restrictions set
forth in this Declaration.

3.Undivided Interest in System

3.0 The owners of the lots shall own the irrigation system in proportion to acreage
owned as equal tenants in common so that each of the lots is irrevocably coupled with a
pro rata undivided interest in the irrigation system. No undivided interest in the irrigation
system shall be severed from the lot to which it is irrevocably coupled. Any conveyance,
encumbrance, lien, alienation or devise of a lot shall also convey, encumber, alienate,
devise or be a lien upon the undivided interest in the irrigation system whether it expressly
provides so or not.

3.1 Owner's rights in the irrigation system and with regard to maintenance of the
interior roadways are exercisable only through Clearwater Farms Association, and in this
respect are assigned to the Association and thereby an individual owner is not able, on his
own, to perform any of the functions delegated to the Association, including but not
limited to irrigating of the land.

4.Reciprocal Easements

4.0 Each of the lots and the Association shall have a non-exclusive blanket
easement for the purpose of ingress and egress to, from and over those parts of the lot,
roadways and irrigation system reasonably required to carry out the provisions of this
Declaration, but such easements shall not unreasonably interfere with the beneficial
enjoyment of the lots by the owners thereof.

5.Rights to Water Reduced by .
the System and Water Charges

5.0 Each of the lots shall be entitled to a share of the water delivered to an by the
irrigation system, subject to all by-laws and ruled and regulations promulgated by the
Association formed under this Declaration to administer the system, and to any applicable
laws and governmental rules and regulations, in proportion to acreage that a parcel bears
to the whole and further provided that the assessments payable to Maricopa County Water
Conservation District No. for the water itself are paid. Payment of the assessments to the
Maricopa County Water Conservation District No. 1 are each individual owner's
responsibility. The right of a buyer to a proportionate share of the water shall always be
subject and conditioned upon payment of the Association’s charges for such water
delivery, and the payment of any assessments made by the Association in accordance with
the purposes set forth herein. Each of the lots, and the respective owner of each
personally, shail be liable for payment of water delivery and maintenance charges
established by the Association from time to time. Declarant shall also be so responsible
for lots which it owns.

6.Liability for Expense of
Operation of the System;
performance of Obligations

6.0 The Association shall maintain the irrigation system and the roadways in good
condition and repair at all times and strictly perform all obligations arising under this
Declaration, the by-laws or rules and regulations promulgated by the Association. Each
lot, and the respective owner of each personally, shall be liable, whether or not actually
using water or the roads, for payment of an equal share of the cost thereof in proportion
to the lots owned in a nonrefundable assessment to be established by the Association from
time to time to create a reserve to defray these obligations. This assessment includes
actual water use and delivery charges which shall be established by the Association to
cover such day to day costs as utilities, water delivery and labor. It does not include the
Maricopa County Water Conservation District No. 1 assessments for the water. These
above Association obligations include, without limitation, routine maintenance, necessary
repairs, replacements, additions to or relocation of, pipelines, ditches, and equipment,
capital or otherwise, and whether resulting from damage, destruction, loss, age,
obsolescence or otherwise, and payment or performance of all other charges and
obligations established by the Association from time to time. To the extent that the
roadways may be maintained by a governmental body at its expense, the owners of the lots
shall not be liable for the cost of such maintenance. If a lot owner fails to pay his share of
any assessment or charges, or perform his obligations, the Association may advance his
share, or perform his obligations, without being under any obligation to do so, such
advance of substituted performance becoming a binding, personal liability of the defaulting
lot owner bearing interest at the highest legal rate from date of advance or substituted
performance until payment, and place a lien against all of the lot(s) of the defaulting lot
owner, which may be foreclosed as a realty mortgage or a mechanic’s lien or in any other
lawful manner at the option of the Association. The defaulting lot owner shall be liable for
all attorneys fees, court costs and other expenses incurred as a result of the defaulting lot
owner’s default hereunder. Also a lot owner in default by more than fifteen (15) days
hereunder loses the right to water and all rights of an owner shall be suspended and shall
not be reinstated until payment of such delinquent assessment, together with interest. The
Association may in an individual case for good cause shown enlarge the time period to
cure a delinquency. The Association shall have all powers to collect said assessments and
charges and any interest and shall have all rights available at law or at equity to do so in
addition to those recited above.

7. Automatic M

7.0 Owner, automatically by virtue of this purchase, becomes a member, along with
all other owners of lots in Clearwater Farms Property Owners Association. Every
conveyance of a lot may expressly recite that it is subject to the provisions of this
Declaration and contain the grantee’s/vendee’s express written acceptance of the
provisions of this Declaration, but this Declaration shall be binding upon each of the lots
and the owners thereof automatically, whether or not there is such an express recitation.

§.Limitations of the Use of Water
8.0 Water delivered by the irrigation system shall only be used to irrigate the

parcels in proportion to acreage owned, at such times and in such quantities as received
from the Irrigation District as the Association may prescribe without discrimination.

meeting of the owners. The Board, which shall be composed of property owners, shall
conduct the affairs of the Association. The Board shall have the power to determine when

those who are current in payment of this assessment) and to make charges or assessments
as provided in the Declaration. The Association shall have the right, through its Board of
Directors, to promulgate rules and regulations which shall be binding upon all owners.
Each year there shall be an annual meeting which shall be held during the month of
October or November as set by the Board. Any such meeting may
be continued from time to time by the Board. At the annual meeting each Board member
for the ensuing year shall be elected by a majority present in person or by proxy. A
majority of the Board or a majority of the owners based upon acreage owned may call a

special meeting upon at least twenty (20) days’ notice for any purpose including enlarging
or reducing the number of members on the Board of Directors, provided such purpose is

stated in the notice. The Board may be expanded by a majority vote of the membership
bases upon acreage owned.
