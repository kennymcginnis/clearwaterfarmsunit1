Of Clearwater Farms Property Owners Association  
**January 9, 2025**

These Rules and Regulations are promulgated by the Board of Directors (“Board”) of the Clearwater Farms Property Owners
Association (“Association”) pursuant to the Board’s authority to make rules and regulations in Sections 9.1 and 9.5.L of
the Clearwater Farms Declaration of Conditions, Covenants and Restrictions and also the Bylaws of the Association. The
violation fines noted in these Rules and Regulations are for reference and do not comprise the Association’s entire fine
list. Please refer to the Association’s violation and fine policy for a complete list of the fines and applicable policy
regarding the same.

## Proxy Votes

- Proxy votes are no longer allowed pursuant to Arizona law. See CC&R’s 9.1. and Bylaws Article IV (3).

## Board of Directors

- An elected Board member must first serve one year on the Board before he/she can be elected President or Vice
  President of the Association.

## Construction Requirements (Update to Use of the Lots 10.0)

- All residences and ADU/guest houses shall be constructed or built and finished on the premises of the lot. No
  Manufactured homes are allowed. The original CC&R term used in 10.0 was Mobile Home. In 1984, Mobile Homes were
  re-classified as Manufactured Homes, but the intent of the CC&Rs remains the same that these structures shall not be
  allowed.

## Improvements to Irrigation (See 9.5H)

- Before adding a culvert or permanent structure to the irrigation system on any lot, the owner must first submit a
  completed written request, including acceptable plans and pictures, to the Board AND receive written approval after a
  vote of the Board, prior to beginning construction.

## Bar Ditches

- Culvert pipes under driveways must be at least 12-inches nominal inside diameter. It is the owner’s responsibility to
  keep the bar ditch in working condition. The base of culvert pipes and the grade of the pipe should be consistent with
  the elevation and grade of the bar ditch to maintain positive flow and proper drainage.

## Dumpsters

- No dumpsters may be placed in the bar ditch on the interior roads or the service alleyways.

## Annual Assessments (See 9.5 A and 6.0)

- Payment for annual assessments is due on September 1st of each year. For those accounts not paid in full by October
  1st, a late fee will be assessed pursuant to the Association’s Documents.

## Returned Checks

- Any person who writes a check that is returned to the Association for insufficient funds, or any other reason, will be
  charged a service fee to cover bank charges and bookkeeping.

## Irrigation

- Each owner must control his/her irrigation for the entire duration of their assigned irrigation interval. The owner is
  also responsible for the ditch to the extent that the owner may not remove soil and/or otherwise degrade the ditch.
  The Association is charged with maintaining, repairing, and replacing ditches as necessary. (SEE CC&R 9.5G). The
  Association is further granted the power to protect and defend the systems from loss and damage, by suit or otherwise
  (see CC&R 9.5J). The Association may take any or all actions available to it to protect and defend the irrigation
  system. See Violation and Fine Policy.

## Maintenance of Property

- Owners are required to maintain their property from the middle of the roadway in front to the middle of the access
  alley in the rear. Existence of an easement does not create a duty on the association to maintain that property within
  the easement. This includes but is not limited to: trimming trees, bushes, grass, weeds, and removing trash and
  debris. Tree limbs and branches overhanging the ditch and/or road must either be trimmed back to the property line or
  to a minimum height of six feet, six inches (6’ 6”) above the ground surface, to allow the Association sufficient
  access to roads and alleys along the irrigation ditches. The Association shall continue the spring spraying for weeds
  that the association has previously undertaken.

## Theft or Diversion of Water

- Theft or Diversion of Water is a crime and may result in criminal penalties or any action granted to the Association
  under the CC&R’s.
